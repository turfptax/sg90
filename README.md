sg90 robot raspi design
I am not good at programming I just enjoy working on projects. My plan is to share all the code I write for my bipedal robot that uses less expensiv3 SG90 motors and MG90 motors for other hobbyist. My hope is that some of the work here could foster creativity for others. Feel free to critique me as I always have more to learn.


Dependencies:
libraries needed found on adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi
#Please support Adafruit if you can by purchasing some of their products, they do a lot of good work in my opinion.
